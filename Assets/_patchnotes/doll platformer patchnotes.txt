1.0

-- added sprite renderer package to project, added rudimentary sprites, animation, events

-- added basic jump and movement (using new Input System...). Player uses ActionMap InGamePlayer

-- created project, set up folders

1.1

-- added custom gravity using Edy's post https://forum.unity.com/threads/why-does-rigidbody-3d-not-have-a-gravity-scale.440415/

-- added jumping using Fernado's post https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/implementing-a-jump-mechanic-unity-6420b106e47a  (with tweaks for 3D Unity project) [removed]

1.2

-- fixed a _bug by removing PlayerInput y values (Player can now only move left and right)

-- added Aim control to character (PlayerInput now reads WASD to aim). added Aim logic to DollPlayer.cs

-- added NPC01 and NPC01 states Attack, Patrol, Take Damage

-- added some rudimentary animation

1.3

-- added StatsComponent.cs for tracking NPC name, HP, move speed, max speed, Attack Power, Sight Distance, Walk Time, Idle Time

-- added Raycast logic to NPC01_PatrolState. casts a ray the size of sight distance and if it detects IPlayer, speeds up. if it gets within a minimum distance from the Player it will enter the Attack State

– Attack state should have interesting logic, ie propel self forward

– Add another State called “active patrol” when the NPC is aggroed and aggressively hunting the Player

-- NPC has a simple State Manager with an Event Manager and an Animation Manager. will need tweaking lol.

1.4

-- added a GroundCheck class. Doll now detects ground properly. Jump is still janky, requires fix

-- added Player sprites version 1.0. Added an animation state controller and linked up sprites

-- added animation logic to Player Movement

1.5

-- created a new folder for Oscars tests

-- made separate players movement and jumping to make it look more fluent and less janky

-- havent included the animation logic as the movement should come first before the animation is included

1.6

-- updated some boring stuff, added Health Component, fiddled with Player states

-- added a Player Attack state with a hitbox

-- added NPC02 (drum NPC)

-- added NPC02 sprite, patrol, attack and take damage state

-- using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgYMRP0FzjM added a child camera and a TopLayer layMask (for rendering a Layer on top of everything else) currently Layer 30

1.7

-- began major refactoring of NPC scripts, condensing into reusable State Machines, States, Event Managers, Animation Controllers, etc

-- added "Take Damage" sprite & anim to NPC02

1.8

-- Marcus added grapple point stuff

1.9

-- Started refactoring Player script(s) to use a State Machine

2.0

-- added NPCDeathState.cs. On death NPCs jump vertically, get pushed back, spin, and fall down. BoxCollider is disabled and once they fall out of sight they destroy themselves. Two problems: 1) setting pushback direction to be consistent either with their current facing position or the direction the Player is attacking from. 2) AddTorque doesn't make the rigidbody spin very much no matter how much the numbers are pumped. It also might be fun to make them move in Z space, becoming smaller if they are knocked away and larger if knocked towards the screen (ie like smash bros)

-- added NPC Editor for testing

-- states now properly transition between each other

-- ModelView properly hooked up states and animations

2.1

-- added NPC02_Drum02 and NPC02_Drum03 prefabs. Added sprites and animations (takes longer than you think) 

TO DO: Make "Conjoined State" for drums

add SFX

fix patrol state

add attack/take damage to work with player

2.2

-- began work on a "Conjoined" variation of the drum NPC's where they start stacked on top of each other. Added ConjoinedState. Added conjoined bool to statsComp. Currently, the conjoined leader can trigger itself and its conjoined bros to attack in sequence

2.3

-- added NPC03_CymbalMonkey. Added sprites and animation. CymbalMonkey uses identical logic to NPC02

-- updated DeathState. The direction of the spinning is now randomised and enemies are knocked back in the direction they are facing

2.4

-- begun elevator, created the base model and view, no real functionality

TO DO: create states for functionality

Create Elevator Music

Add placeholder SFX

2.5

-- added PaddyBoi's Snare Monster SFX

-- added the best to NPC02SFX.cs, added rudimentary audio source and loader (refactor later)

-- added SFX logic to states & prefabs

2.6

-- refactored NPC02SFX.cs into a single script. Script is placed on an object w/audio source. Contains a List of NPC02 GameObjects. When added NPC02 adds itself to the List which is then subscribes itself to listening to ModelView events

-- any GameObject with a StatsComponent.cs now add themselves to the subscription on spawn and unsub on death

2.7

-- further reworked the Player into using State machine itself

-- converted all animation logic into using states and Play.clip

2.8

-- almost completed refactoring Player states

-- fiddled with rigidbody stuff to make the jump stuff actually work

-- (hack update will need further polishing)

-- TO DO: continue refactoring jump / movement

-- kill an NPC with an attack!!

2.9

-- added SpawnNPC function to Level Manager to fix an issue with NPC's not detecting the SFX script properly. this spawn logic will need further updating later

-- Player Attack state now correctly hits NPCs and ChangeHP() thru ITakeDamage

-- general bug fixes

3.0

-- completed overhauling Player Movement and Player States. there is an additional state machine within PlayerMovement.cs to track all this nonsense. Tonnes of tweaking and updating. Lots of bug fixes.

-- changed DollPlayerJumpState to use animation curve jump style (still needs tweaking)

-- added an offset to attackstate dependant on the facingRight bool

-- added controller/gamepad controls

-- NPCs now properly damage and kill the Player too

3.1

-- added NPC05 Hanging Doll, default sprite and prefab. Added NPC05MoveState.cs. When entering Move State Hanging Doll fires a Raycast down and moves towards the first Ground layer point it hits

-- added Rope object. Rope object will extend with Hanging Doll and be swung from later

-- added Dpad support to controls

3.2

-- NPC05 HangingState now detects the player and moves towards a position while spotted, else it moves back to its point of origin.

-- added an OnFall event for the Player

-- added the track "Father"
